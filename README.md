## Details

This is my first dive into creating a full size keyboard and having a lot more using with KiCad. I got a lot of inspiration from other hackclubbers making keyboards and also wanted to take the hackpad project that I did one step further. I always use an ipad a lot for school work and I also usually need to do a lot of typing and use shortcuts for CADding in robotics, so having my own keyboard is a big help. This was a lot of fun to build and design, especially experimenting with the different designs that I could put onto the case with my own artwork.

## Side Notes

I do understand the preference of getting supplies from places like AliExpress, but unfortunately, living in Hawaii removes a lot of the options that are even availble on such websites. The best option for getting things to Hawaii in time for the Highway event is unfortunately going to need increased shipping. That means that some items in my BOM are a little pricier that AliExpress or otherwise counterparts but they are guaranteed able to arrive on time for the end of the event.
