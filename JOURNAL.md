| Elemental Designs Keyboard | @samatua1221-2896 | A custom mechanical keyboard | 7/20/25 |

# July 20, 2025 (7 hrs)

So I've actually spent a lot of time wanting to have my own keyboard for a while now (especially when dealing with the thing that Apple calls its keybaord for ipads *cough**cough*ipad folio*cough**cough*) but this is really something I don't have too much experience in but plan on getting it down pretty easily. As of now I've already worked to design a couple of PCBs, one for hackpad and one for my own 3D pen, so seeing that majority of a keyboard is just the PCB I'm looking forward to this.

So far my plan is to have an almost full keboard layout with some adjustments like getting rid of the f keys and adding two rotary encoders. I'll have some of the usual keys transformed maybe into custom shortcut keys for CADding since that's what I'll probably doing most with the keyboard.

This is how I think I'll be formatting my keyboard so far so I'll go with this and make a DXF file to align all of my switches on my PCB.

*A couple hours later*

So after doing all of that, I started to work on my schematic for my project itself. I don't really know too much about how to make a schematic for a keyboard so I ended up doing a little but of research which did help me a little bit in understanding what to do. I'll be using a RasPi Pico as my brain and pretty standard cherry mx switches for all of my keys. I still haven't decided whether I should make custom keycaps or just 3D print them in the end. I'll end of figuring all that out later.

So this is how I laid out my whole design for my schematic, I checked a couple of sources and ran ERC a couple of times, so far it looks all good so tomorrow I'll move onto working on the rest of the PCB board itself.
